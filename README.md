# wesocify
## A social networking web app similar to Twitter.

Written from scratch by me.

The reason for this project is for <strong>Nigerians</strong> to have their own locally made social networking web app similar to Twitter.

The name <strong>"wesocify"</strong> isn't the final name for the project.
It's just a placeholder name I came up with.
Which doesn't make much sense anyway 😅.

Although, the project still has a long way to go, but I'm gradually making progress.

## Tech Stack:
<p><strong>Front-end:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript </p>
<p><strong>Back-end:</strong> Python (Django) </p>
<p><strong>DBMS:</strong> SQLite (for now), I'll be using PostgreSQL on production. </p>
<hr>
<p>So, that's been it.</p>

Thank you. <br>
